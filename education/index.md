# Comprehensive Sex Education

## Education

As both sides of the argument can agree, a great way to reduce the need for abortion is to prevent unwanted pregnancies. Education is key to helping women understand the options available to prevent pregnancy.

But Americans are divided about what types of sex education should be available to children. Schools should reflect the values of our communities.

For many people, high school marks the end of their general education. Once students complete high school, they should be equipped with the information they need to live successful lives. For this reason, primary school health class must prepare our children for adulthood with comprehensive sex education.
