# Ethical Pro Life

Politicians have made abortion a battle, but it doesn't need to be.  Americans can unite around a common vision that celebrates and values life **without** restricting women's human rights.

The rate of abortion has been declining for decades now. This decline is driven by improvements to our society that reduce the need for abortion services. Whether you believe abortion is an essential medical procedure or a violation of sacred human life, most of us can agree on the end goal of reducing the need for abortion care.
