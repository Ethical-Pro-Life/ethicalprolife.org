Politicians have made abortion a battle, but it doesn't need to be.  Americans can unite around a common vision that celebrates and values life **without** restricting womens' human rights.

The rate of abortion has been declining for decades now. This decline is driven by improvements to our society that reduce the need for abortion services.
