# Supporting Families

## Supporting Families

Ethical Pro Life means supporting legislation that guarantees new families social support. Raising a family requires major financial, emotional, and time commitments. People facing the decision of whether or not to bring a new life into the world would #ChooseLife more often if they were guaranteed supports like:

* Paid maternity and paternity leave
* Affordable child care options
* Medical and nutrition support if poor
* Safe transportation options
