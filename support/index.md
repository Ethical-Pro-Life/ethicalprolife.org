# Supporting Families

## Supporting Families

Ethical Pro Life means supporting legislation that guarantees new families social support. Raising a family requires major financial, emotional, and time commitments. People facing the decision of whether or not to bring a new life into the world would #ChooseLife more often if they were guaranteed supports like:

* Paid maternity and paternity leave
* Affordable child care options
* Guaranteed medical, housing, and nutrition support
* Safe transportation options

When a family considers their ability to raise a child, all these factors contribute to their confidence and ability. Knowing these basic needs can be met for themselves and their new child is a key factor in increasing the likelihood a family with an unplanned pregnancy will choose to carry that pregnancy to term.
