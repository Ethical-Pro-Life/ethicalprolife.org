# Health Care Access

Having access to safe health care options is the hallmark of national success. By improving access to health care options, we can reduce the need for abortion in America, especially later term abortions.

## Access to Contraceptive Health Care

As human members of our society, women deserve access to safe health care. They deserve the freedom to choose what they want for their own lives without interference from external social expectations for them. And women deserve these things without social shame or stigma associated with their choices.

### Long Lasting Contraception

Long-lasting contraception is an extremely effective and reversible method for eliminating the risk of unwanted pregnancies. By working to eliminate the stigma associated with seeking long-term contraception options, we can reduce the rate of unwanted pregnancy and reduce the need for abortion services.

#### Intrauterine Devices (IUDs)

Thanks to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), insurance providers must now cover the cost of contraception options at little or no out of pocket cost to women who need them.  By raising awareness of this option for women who wish to be sexually active without pregnancy, we can virtually eliminate unwanted pregnancy and the associated abortions.

#### Tubal Ligation ("Tubes Tied")

Many women know that they don't want children. But sadly, medical providers often discriminate by [refusing a woman's request](https://www.bustle.com/p/can-doctors-refuse-tubal-ligation-heres-why-its-hard-to-get-one-to-tie-your-tubes-19233587) to have her tubes tied.  Common justifications are that the procedure is hard to reverse and the patient may [change her mind](https://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/ct-xpm-2014-05-13-ct-met-sterilization-denied-20140513-story.html).  By contrast, men seeking a vasectomy can often get the procedure done on short order.  

We must end this sexist double-standard in health care settings.  Doing so will reduce the need for abortion.  The [American College of Gynecology says](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2017/04/sterilization-of-women-ethical-issues-and-considerations?utm_source=redirect&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=int)

    Respect for an individual womanâ€™s reproductive autonomy should be the primary concern guiding sterilization provision and policy.

## Abortion Access

Many unethical policies seek to delay women's access to safe abortion services by introducing medically unnecessary legal hoops for women who need abortion care. Interfering with a person's access to safe health care is unethical and needs to be reversed.

These laws can require of [waiting periods](https://www.guttmacher.org/report/impact-state-mandatory-counseling-and-waiting-period-laws-abortion-literature-review), multiple visits, or invasive medical procedures.

Research shows that waiting periods cause abortions to be delayed into later phases of pregnancy where we all agree that harm is increased and shifted abortion services out of state.
