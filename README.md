The Ethical Pro-Life Website

The intent of this site is to encourage people who identify as "Pro Life" to conaider the ethical problems associated 
with restricting safe abortion access.  By representing the position as "Ethical Pro Life," we hope to attract people 
who otherwise might not consider Pro Choice views or issues.
